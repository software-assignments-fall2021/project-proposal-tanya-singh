### Project title
NYU Classes 2.0 

### What and why?
This new software will allow students to customize their own digital, daily 'student planner'. Allowing students to decide what is shown when entering the app will allow for more efficiency throughout one's work day, and will allow students to stay organized and on top of their classes, assignments, and other tasks. Currently, NYU Classes / NYU Brightspaces are managed and created by professors. Students are able to access these websites and only see what professors chose to post, in the format they chose to post them in. Typically, professors organize their class pages in a specific, unique way to fit their liking - which causes each class to be organized in different ways, making it difficult for students to navigate between classes (especially at the beginning of the semester). By having one application that will conslidate all this information and have it available within one page, students will be able to have a better picture of their tasks for a specific day, making this information a lot more accessible. Ultimately, rather than having to look through four different class pages, students will only have to look at one. 

### For whom?
This software will be designed and created for college students, like ourselves. While at first, we may specifically focus on desigining with NYU students in mind, as we know the resources that we work with, ultimately we hope that this app will be able to be consumed by a variety of college students. 

### How?
Students will be able to use the software to organize their school work and any personal tasks all in one place. They can enter all assignments and deadlines and will have the ability to sort them by class and due date. This software will allow students to find everything they need in one place. The application will open up to a dashboard, containing an individuals classes / other commitments for the day as well as any upcoming assigment deadlines and other specified deadlines. Ultimately, the content within the dashboard will be decided by the student. The app will easily allow them to customize their own experience based on what they deem to be most important. This can include specific classes to show (times / class location), deadlines to display, reminders, etc. Beyond the dashboard will be seperate pages containing a calendar (daily, weekly & monthly views), an upcoming assigments page, to do lists, notes, and more. While most pages will have a general template for students to easily input information, students will still have the option to customize each page to their liking. 

### Scope
This project will allow us to work with new frameworks like React, but also taps into things we have some familiarity with like UI design and object oriented programming. Additionally, with more people working on this project, we will be able to put our focus on multiple important features to put out an end product that will be functional for students.
